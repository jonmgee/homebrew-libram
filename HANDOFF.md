### Sub-category system (2026-06-18)

- [x] Sub-category landing pages at `/browse/:category` — card grid with real entry counts from Supabase
- [x] Human-readable sub-category labels (e.g. "Wondrous Items" not "wondrous_items")
- [x] "Misc" sub-category catches unclaimed types (uses `/assets/misc.webp`)
- [x] Routing: `/browse/treasure/weapons`, `/browse/arcana/spells`, etc.

### Styling (2026-06-19)

- [x] PHB-inspired fantasy theme:
  - Parchment background (#EDE0C8), dark ink text (#1a1a1a)
  - Near-black book-cover page background (#1a0a00)
  - Google Fonts: Cinzel (headings), IM Fell English (body)
  - Gilded multi-layer gold borders on category/sub-category cards
  - Wax-seal type badges (crimson)
  - DM ink-stamp badges on browse entries
- [x] Responsive — cards stack on small screens
- [x] Hover effects on cards (gilded glow, border transitions)

### Homepage & sub-category image cards (2026-06-21)

- [x] 6 watercolour PNGs converted to 300×300 WebP (98.4% reduction), then swapped to Graphic style
- [x] 5 graphic images lightened by 15% (Arcana untouched) via Pillow
- [x] **Homepage cards redesigned:** square (aspect-square) with full-bleed backgrounds, dark gradient overlay, gold text (Mr Eaves), gilded borders
- [x] **Sub-category cards rebuilt identically:** 13 sub-cat images + misc image, same full-bleed square layout
- [x] All sub-cat images lightened by 15% via Pillow
- [x] Original PNGs removed from git tracking, `images/` and `Images/` in `.gitignore`
- [x] Commits: 050a797 → 68937a3 (homepage), 555f4b9 (sub-category)

### Bug fixes (2026-06-19)

- [x] "Unknown Category" heading in All Entries view — fixed with `useLocation` fallback
- [x] Redundant type badge in sub-category view — gated behind `isAll` check
- [x] Escaped unicode `\u2026` → literal `…` character
- [x] Table type missing from `ENTRY_TYPES` array — button wasn't rendering
- [x] Form state bleeding on type switch — reset to EMPTY_FORM

## Known gaps

- [ ] **Entry editing** — no edit form; entries can only be created and deleted
- [ ] **Auth** — anon policies are temporary; needs Supabase Auth integration
- [ ] **Table rendering** — tables are browsable but don't render as interactive rollable tables
- [ ] **Henge illustration** — placeholder on home page, replace with image in `public/assets/` as webp when ready
- [ ] **Mobile optimisation** — responsive but not fully polished for small screens
- [ ] **Pagination** — no pagination for large entry lists
- [ ] **Import/export** — no bulk import or export of entries

## Next tasks

Awaiting brief — options include:
- Entry detail/view page
- Entry editing
- Auth integration
- Table rendering (interactive rollable tables)
- Henge illustration
- Mobile polish
- Pagination
- Import/export
